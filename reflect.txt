1. Price1 does not properly display the intended value because a float only takes 4 bytes which means it can hold up to 7 decimal digits making its precision less accurate when using a decimal value. The other samples work as expected because sometimes it can be more accurate depending on its precision and a double holds 8 bytes of memory storage meaning it can go to 15 decimal points.


2. The three examples work as intended because an explicit form of casting or promotion is used to display it as a floating point value with 2 decimal places. By dividing it by 100.0 or declaring it as a (double) makes it explicit conversion because it is a code instruction.


3. a) The value of the variable result is either $0.00 using %.2lf or $72 using %d because it's an implicit conversion called coercion that is automatically done by the compiler. It is not explicit because there was no casting or promotion done by the user so the machine reads it as an int. 
        
        b) The values displayed are
                1) $0.00 
                2) $72
                3) $0.00
                4) $72


        c) I concluded that the printf function causes samples 1 and 3 to not work as expected 
            because the variable is declared as an int but it is trying to display a %.2lf meaning a 
            long double variable.
